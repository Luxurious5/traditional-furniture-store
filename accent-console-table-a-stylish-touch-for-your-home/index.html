Here are some tips for caring for your pieces:</p><h3>1. Regular Cleaning</h3><p>Dust your furniture regularly using a soft cloth. For wood pieces, avoid abrasive cleaners that can scratch surfaces.</p><h3>2. Use Coasters</h3><p>To protect surfaces from heat and moisture, always use coasters under drinks and plates.</p><h3>3. Address Scratches Immediately</h3><p>If scratches occur, address them immediately with wood polish or touch-up markers designed for furniture.</p><h3>4.
